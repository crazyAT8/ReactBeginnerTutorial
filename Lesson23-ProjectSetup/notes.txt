Lesson 23 
Challenge: Project setup

- Create a ' components' folder
- Create the following components in seperate files inside
    the components folder. In each one, just render an 'h1'
    with the name of the component (e.g. return <h1>Navbar goes here</h1>):
        - Navbar
        - Main 
- Create an App component outside the components folder (sibling to the index.js file)
    + Have App render the Navbar and Main components
- Import and render the App component inside of index.js using ReactDOM
    + At this point you should have your "Navbar goes here" etc. 
        showing up in the mini-browser.
- Go to Google fonts and get the "Inter" font with weights 400, 600, and 700.
    Put the links to those fonts ABOVE the style.css link in index.html 
    (Use the '<link/>' elements instead of the @import or npm options
    for getting the fonts. You may need to do som extra research to figure out 
    how this works if you haven't done it before)



Components (x2 files)
    both have import react
        export default function
            with a simple HTML return

App.js
    imports both components and react
        returns a div container
            with the components tagged inside 
index.js 
    imports 
        React, ReactDOM, App, and file path to styles.css 
    ReactDOM render
        the App as a tag 
            and gets the id root from the document HTML
index.html 
    usual boiler plate header
        google font links
        and css 
            but note that the css link doesn't effect the page 
                only when we import it it into index does it work
Styles.css 
    calling the body tag 
        and assigning the fonts to them

25. Main Section
    Challenge: Build the main section!

        Skip 2 aspects of the design for now: 
            1. The colored bullets in the list
            2. The large React logo on the side 

        Those will be separate challenges coming up

26. Color the bullets 
    look up psudo selector ::marker on MDN web docs

27. Add Background logo

Challenge: Place the gray react logo in the Background

Don't use an 'img' element, but rather set it as the 'background-image' of the 'main' element.

Hint: you'll need to use the following properties:
    - background-image
    - background-repeat
    - background-position

(Or the shorthand 'background' property with values for all those other properties)
