3. Build a React info site | First React

4. Build a React info site | First React Practice

5. Lesson5-LocalSetup(theQuickWay)
        they just show you how set up live server in visual studio

6. Build a React info site | Why React? It's Composable!
    - it's composable
        make a library of features
            make anything from the library a function and then call upon it
    - it's declarative (opposite is Imperative)
        we can tell it what should be done
            computer says
                "just tell me what to do, and I'll worry about how I get it done"
        Imperatively
            how should it be done?
                computer says
                    "describe to me every step on how to do something, and I'll do it"
                        aka "vanilla javaScript"
    - it's a hirable skill
    - it's actively maintained by skilled people

8. Build a REact info site | JSX
    - how to write multiple html elements 
        inside one rendering
    - always have a parent element

9. Build a React info site | Goodbye, CDNs!

10. Build a React info Site | Thought Experiment

11. Build a React info site | Project 1 Part 1- MarkUp
    // saving your JSX to a single variable 
            is not a common use in react
    // going to start covering how to create
            custom components

12. Build a React info site | Pop Quiz! 
    1. Why do we need 'import React from "react"' in our file?
            React is what defines JSX

    2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js what would show up?
            A JavaScript Object
                React elements that describe what 
                    React should eventually add to the real DOM for us.

    3. Whats wrong with this code:
            const page = (
                <h1>Hello</h1>
                <p>This is my website!</p>
            )
        we need our JSX to be nested under a single parent element
    
    4. What does it mean for something to be "declaritive" instead of "imperative"?
            Declarative means I can tell the computer what to do
                and expect it to handle the details.
                    Imperative means I need to 
                        tell it how to do each step
    
    5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
            We have small pieces that we can put together
                to make something larger/greater
                    than the individual pieces

13. Build a React info site | Custom Components
    - stuffing all your elements into one place 
        eg a single render or variable
            makes it really hard to edit
    - instead of a single variable
        make it a function instead

    - Rules that need to be followed for writing a
            React Component from a JavaScript Function 
        1. we need to us pascal case instead of camol case for our names
                which means that you have to capitalize the first letter
        2. need to wrap our component/function calls in
                angle brackets </>
                    just like html
    - why are we making one component
        with a tone of little itty bitty things inside
            thought we were supposed to be dividing those up

15. Build a React info site | Custom Components Quiz 
                        1. What is a React component?
                                //a function that return React Elements. (UI)
                                    //it can be run over and over

                        2. What's wrong with this code?
                        .....
                        function myComponent() {                        //Not in Pascal Case
                            return (
                                <small>I'm tiny text!</small>
                            )
                        }
                        ......

                        3. What's wrong with this code?
                        ......
                        function Header() {
                            return (
                                <header>
                                    <nav>
                                        <img src=".react-logo.png" width="40px">
                                    </nav>
                                </header>
                            )
                        }

                    ReactDOM.render(Header(), document.getElementById("root));

                            // need to render with self-closing angeled brackets

16. Build a React info site | Parent/Child Components
    - split the header into its own component
        and the rest of the body into the other
            then call them both with a Render
    OR
    - you can call the header
        inside the body function
            with a simple <Header />

17. Build a React info site | Styling with Classes 
    - adding a nav bar
        to the upper right of the web page
    - when declaring a class in React
        you have to us the keyword
            "className"
                bc react is taking these JSX elements
                    and turning them into native DOM elements
    - Vanilla JavaScript Equivalent
        const ul = document.createElement("ul")
        ul.className = "";
